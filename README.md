## Description

An assignment for udacity's blog template project built to pass the project rubric specifications. Features lots of custom CSS and a veiled satire of my fianc√©e who has nice hair IRL.

## To run

Clone and open index.html in the browser of your choice (chrome?).

## Gratitude

Font Awesome, Google Fonts, Udacity
